Open Transactions, Server and Asset Contracts
=============================================

The goal is to create a variety of strong and legitimate server contracts, along with several equally strong and 
legitimate asset contracts, which can then be used to trade, for example: digital gold, digital silver, "digital" 
bitcoin, and other valuable assets and commodities, across many different servers. The vision is for these servers 
to be low-trust and federated, using voting pools to secure and release assets with zero risk.

###Completed and working on
* basic Digital Gold Grams asset contract
* basic Digital Silver Grams asset contract
* sample localhost contract taken directly from the Open Transactions sample-data folder
* public server will be hosted within days, and public server contract published

For now, I have two basic asset contracts for Digital Gold Grams, and Digital Silver Grams, aswell as a sample localhost 
contract. I'm currently working on completing a public server contract and getting it onlineâ€”I should have that 
completed very soon.
