Open Transactions, Server and Asset Contracts
====================================

The goal is to create a strong and legitimate server contract along with several equally strong and legitimate asset contracts, which can then be used to trade, for example: digital gold, digital silver, "digital" bitcoin, and other valuable assets and commodities, across many different serversâ€”the vision is for these servers to all be federated and these contracts to become the standard.
