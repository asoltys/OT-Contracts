Open Transactions, Server and Asset Contracts
=============================================

The goal is to create a variety of strong and legitimate server contracts, along with several equally strong and 
legitimate asset contracts—these contracts can then be used to trade, for example: digital gold, digital silver, "digital" 
bitcoin, and other valuable assets and commodities, across many different servers. The vision is for these servers 
to be low-trust and federated, securing and releasing assets and funds with zero risk.

###What's been done, and what I'd like to do

I currently have two basic asset contracts: Digital Gold Grams, and Digital Silver Grams; I would like to develop
these asset contracts—as well as all of this project's future contracts—into proper technical and legal documents 
that can be used on plug and play for-profit servers.

###Completed and working on:
* Completed: basic Digital Silver Grams asset contract
* Completed: basic Digital Gold Grams asset contract
* Working on: hosting basic public server
* Working on: publishing basic public server contract

###How to use sample data

Copy the contents of the /sample-data directory into your ~/.ot directory.

###Smart Contracts

The first smart contract I'd like to create would be used to monitor the blockchain and bail in and out 
bitcoins in exchange for "digital" bitcoin (digiBTC?) automatically. It could be attached to a website or application etc; the user would enter his 
bitcoin address and then send the BTC to the servers bitcoin address, when the smart contract sees that the transaction has been confirmed 
on the blockchain it would then automattically issue digiBTC to the user's account.
