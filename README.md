Open Transactions, Server and Asset Contracts
=============================================

The goal is to create a variety of strong and legitimate server contracts, along with several equally strong and 
legitimate asset contracts—these contracts can then be used to trade, for example: digital gold, digital silver, "digital" 
bitcoin, and other valuable assets and commodities, across many different servers. The vision is for these servers 
to be low-trust and federated, using voting pools to secure and release assets with zero risk.

###What's been done, and what I'd like to do

I currently have two basic asset contracts: Digital Gold Grams, and Digital Silver Grams; I would like to develop
these asset contracts—as well as all of this project's future contracts—into proper technical and legal documents 
that can be used on plug and play for-profit servers.

###Completed and working on:
* Completed: basic Digital Silver Grams asset contract
* Completed: basic Digital Gold Grams asset contract
* Working on: hosting basic public server
* Working on: publishing basic public server contract
