Open Transactions, Server and Asset Contracts
=============================================

The goal is to create a variety of strong and legitimate server contracts, along with several equally strong and 
legitimate asset contracts, which can then be used to trade, for example: digital gold, digital silver, "digital" 
bitcoin, and other valuable assets and commodities, across many different servers. The vision is for these servers 
to be low-trust and federated, using voting pools to secure and release assets with zero risk.
