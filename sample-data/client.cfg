;; LATENCY:

;; For sending and receiving:
;; blocking=true (usually not recommended) means OT will hang on the send/receive
;; call, and wait indefinitely until the send or receive has actually occurred.
;; IF BLOCKING IS FALSE (normal, default):
;; - no_tries is the number of times OT will try to send or receive a message.
;; - ms is the number of milliseconds it will wait between each attempt.
;; UPDATE: send_ms and receive_ms now DOUBLE after each failed attempt! (up to 3 tries)
;; Meaning that after 3 tries, it's already waited over 21 seconds trying to get
;; the message. 
;; send_delay_after happens after EVERY SINGLE server request/reply, which can be
;; multiple times per use case. (They can add up quick...)
